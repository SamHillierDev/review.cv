# Uploading Your CV

ReviewCV supports multiple file formats and upload methods.

## Supported Formats

| Format | Extension | Notes |
|--------|-----------|-------|
| PDF | `.pdf` | Recommended — preserves formatting |
| Word Document | `.docx` | Modern Word format |
| Legacy Word | `.doc` | Older Word format |

## Upload Methods

### Drag and Drop

Drag your CV file directly onto the upload area on the homepage. The drop zone will highlight when a file is hovering over it.

### Click to Browse

Click the upload area to open your system file picker, then select your CV file.

## File Requirements

- **Maximum file size**: 1 MB
- **One file at a time**: Upload a single CV per analysis
- **Text-based content**: The CV must contain selectable text (scanned image PDFs are not supported)

## Troubleshooting

### File not accepted

Make sure your file is one of the supported formats (PDF, DOCX, or DOC) and is under 1 MB.

### Analysis seems incomplete

If your CV is a scanned image PDF, the text cannot be extracted. Re-create your CV in a text-based format or use OCR software to convert it first.
